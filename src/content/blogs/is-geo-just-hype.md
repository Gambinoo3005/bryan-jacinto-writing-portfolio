If you've been anywhere near digital marketing circles lately, you've probably heard people talking about GEO, or Generative Engine Optimization. It's the latest buzzword making the rounds, and like most new things in SEO, it's getting a lot of attention.

Some people are treating it like the next big revolution. Others are calling it snake oil, just repackaged SEO with a fancier name.

I've been paying attention to this stuff because I need to. I'm still learning SEO and web dev, and keeping up with what's actually useful versus what's just marketing hype is part of the job. So I wanted to dig into GEO and figure out if it's something worth caring about or just another trend that'll fade away.

## The elevator pitch

GEO stands for Generative Engine Optimization. The idea is simple: optimize your content not just for traditional search engines like Google, but for AI-powered platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google's AI Overviews, and Gemini.

Instead of trying to rank number one on a search results page, you're trying to get your content cited or referenced in AI-generated answers. When someone asks ChatGPT or Perplexity a question, you want your website to be one of the sources it pulls from and mentions.

The term was [first introduced in November 2023 by six researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735) who published a paper describing it as a new way for content creators to improve visibility in AI-generated responses.

## Why this actually matters

The shift is real, even if the hype is overblown.

According to recent data, [more than 58% of Google searches now end without a click](https://www.deptagency.com/insight/building-the-future-of-generative-engine-optimization-geo/) because AI delivers instant results right on the search page. ChatGPT alone has over 180 million monthly users, many of whom use it as their primary search tool.

That's a big shift. If your content isn't showing up in AI-generated answers, you're missing a growing chunk of potential traffic.

Traditional SEO focused on getting clicks. But if AI is answering questions directly, what matters now is whether AI platforms recognize your content as credible enough to cite.

## Just SEO with extra steps?

This is where the "snake oil" accusations come from.

GEO isn't a replacement for SEO. It's an extension of it. A lot of what makes good SEO also makes good GEO: clear content, proper structure, answering user questions directly, authoritative sources.

[About 50% of sources cited in Google AI Overviews](https://www.deptagency.com/insight/building-the-future-of-generative-engine-optimization-geo/) also rank in the top 10 traditional search results. So if your SEO fundamentals are solid, you're already halfway there.

But GEO does add some new considerations. AI platforms care more about comprehensiveness and whether your content anticipates related sub-questions, not just the main query. For example, if someone asks "What is local SEO?" an AI might pull from a source that defines it, covers why it matters, how to get started, and common mistakes. It's looking for depth and context.

## What the data shows

The [original 2023 research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735) tested different optimization methods and found that certain strategies could boost visibility in AI-generated responses by up to 40%. The methods that worked best were:

- Adding relevant statistics and data
- Including quotations from credible sources
- Citing other authoritative sources
- Structuring content to answer multiple related questions

These aren't revolutionary tactics. They're just good content practices that happen to work well with how AI models synthesize information.

## Where the snake oil starts

A bunch of tools and services popped up claiming to help with GEO. Some are probably useful. Others feel like rebranded SEO tools charging more because "AI" is in the name.

I've seen agencies promising to track your "AI citation share" as if it's an established metric. But the truth is, this stuff is still really new. We don't have years of data showing what actually works long-term.

AI platforms change how they work constantly. What gets you cited in ChatGPT today might not work in six months. The algorithms are black boxes.

That doesn't mean GEO is useless. It just means you should be cautious about anyone claiming they've cracked the code or selling expensive courses on "mastering GEO."

## What actually works

Strip away the hype, and here's what seems practical:

**Answer questions completely.** AI platforms favor content that anticipates follow-up questions. Write like you're explaining something to a real person who wants to understand the topic fully.

**Use structured data.** Schema markup helps AI platforms parse your content. FAQ schema, HowTo schema, and proper heading structures all make a difference.

**Cite credible sources.** AI models seem to favor content that references other authoritative sources. It signals that your content is well-researched.

**Write with depth.** Shallow, keyword-stuffed articles don't cut it. AI platforms pull from sources that provide real substance.

**Keep your SEO strong.** If you're not ranking well in traditional search, you probably won't show up in AI results either. GEO builds on good SEO, it doesn't replace it.

## Red flags to watch for

GEO crosses into snake oil territory when people:

- Claim proprietary methods that guarantee AI citations
- Charge huge premiums for "GEO services" that are just standard content optimization
- Promise instant results or specific ranking guarantees
- Sell tools tracking metrics nobody's validated yet

The AI space moves too fast for anyone to have all the answers. Be skeptical.

## Takeaway

GEO isn't snake oil, but it's not a revolution either. It's a practical response to how search behavior is changing as more people use AI platforms to find information. The tactics that work overlap heavily with good SEO practices like clear writing, structured content, and authoritative sourcing.

If you're already doing solid SEO work, adapting for AI platforms is a natural next step. Just be wary of anyone selling it as a magic solution or charging premium prices for rebranded basics. Focus on the fundamentals, write for real people, and you'll probably do fine in both traditional search and AI-generated results.
