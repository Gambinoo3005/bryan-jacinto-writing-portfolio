  <h2>1. Automated, Flexible Quoting and Order Management</h2>
</div>

<div class="blog-section">
  <p>Excelling in quoting and estimating for clients relies heavily on accurate calculations, without sacrificing speed. An industrial manufacturing ERP solution can help discrete manufacturers automate tasks such as margin analysis and generating bills of materials (BOMs). The automation saves time, reduces errors and helps ensure that quotes are accurate and delivered to customers on time.</p>

  <p>In addition to improving accuracy and streamlining processes, an ERP solution with quoting and order management features built-in can also provide valuable insights into customer buying habits and trends. Manufacturers can leverage data-driven insights to make informed business decisions and improve client satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP is made with flexibility in mind as well, allowing discrete manufacturers to easily handle customer-configured products at the point of sale and assigning bespoke pricing structures to meet specific customer needs.</p>

  <h2>2. Precise Inventory Management with Real-Time Visibility</h2>
</div>

<div class="blog-section">
  <p>Industrial manufacturers require express and accurate pricing estimates to secure new business partnerships while maintaining relationships with their existing ones. With an ERP system in place, manufacturers can easily access real-time inventory data and pricing information to provide accurate price calculations for an existing client or new prospect.</p>

  <p>With a centralized data repository, information silos are removed, ensuring that all teams in the organization are on the same page when giving project cost estimates. ERP features such as materials management automates inventory data collection facilitating precise resource management through tracking material lots.</p>

  <p>We offer robust industrial manufacturing ERP software that has a contact and activity management tool which consolidates contact and account information and provides access to past and current sales data. Users can also leverage the tool as a scheduler for future meetings and list to-do items that everyone in the organization can easily view.</p>

  <h2>3. Secure Cloud-Based Deployment and Accessibility</h2>
</div>

<div class="blog-section">
  <p>Manufacturers are migrating their ERP applications to the cloud at a rapid pace. A recent study found that all but 10% of process and industrial manufacturers have begun their journey to cloud-hosted software by investigating the move, making the move or have already moved to the cloud. And for good reason. In addition to the accessibility and business continuity benefits garnered by a cloud-based ERP, manufacturers can easily scale and adapt their operations.</p>
