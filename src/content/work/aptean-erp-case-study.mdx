  <h2>Company Background</h2>
  <p>As the pioneer for "zero penetration" roof systems, Portable Pipe Hangers Systems/Design (PHP) has supported engineers, architects and property owners with their high-quality and innovative products. The business was founded in 1992 in Houston, Texas, where it operates to this day. PHP's product line includes rooftop components such as pipes, walkways, crossovers, platforms, equipment supports, cable trays and ducts—all made with high-quality, durable custom bases and high-density polypropylene materials combined with a UV additive.</p>
  
  <p>By leveraging Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP, PHP has achieved consistent growth over two decades. But their workflows and reliance on internal hardware for data backups presented a major challenge, which was compounded by the pandemic, further exposing inefficiencies in their company-wide processes.</p>

  <p>"Remote working wasn't something we did because we're a manufacturing company. We had to be on-site to ensure things were being put into the shop and correctly manufactured."</p>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"The biggest benefit that we are expecting from moving to the cloud is remote access. Not having a physical server, not having to maintain that and not having to get on site in case there will be computer and server crashes for long periods of time."</p>

  <h2>The Migration to a Cloud-Based Aptean ERP</h2>
</div>

<p>While moving their enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution to a Software as a Service (SaaS) model had been a consideration for PHP in the past, it had never been a top priority. However, the gradual shift in workplace structure and the macroeconomic environment caused by the pandemic prompted the company's leadership to re-evaluate their operations and connect with the Aptean team to look for solutions to support their remote work initiative.</p>

<p>During the migration, the Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP team worked closely with PHP, sharing best practices and industry knowledge to ensure the organization's digital transformation journey would run smoothly. With the help of Aptean's industry experts and implementation professionals, PHP was able to set realistic and comfortable timeframes for the implementation process and conducted routine testing to help ensure a smooth transition.</p>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"Our main point of contact at Aptean did a tremendous job for us, staying in contact constantly. The entire project team also stayed in contact with us. During the testing phase, they answered all my questions; if I shot an e-mail or text, they would respond immediately."</p>
  <p class="attribution">— Jason Fulton, IT Manager</p>
</div>

<p>After the smooth migration, PHP was able to jump back to work immediately.</p>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"The way we do things hasn't changed at all, which is a big plus for us. We didn't have to stop and redo processes and change the way we do things and get people to do things differently."</p>

<div class="section-header">
  <h2>Company-Wide Remote Access through Cloud</h2>
</div>

<p>In order to ensure company-wide remote access, PHP identified that they needed to migrate Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP to the cloud. Fulton stated that the organization had remote access before, but it wasn't on par with what a cloud-enabled solution is capable of.</p>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"Before moving our on-premise ERP solution to the cloud, there were multiple steps needed, including a VPN connection, to access the system which made it more cumbersome."</p>
  <p class="attribution">— Jason Fulton, IT Manager</p>
</div>

<p>As a cloud-based solution, Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP allowed the business's employees to remotely access the company's servers and connect to the system from almost anywhere. Employees also have the ability to easily log in or out on any terminal, removing the need for 1:1 computer workstations–offering employees the flexibility to connect from the plant floor, in the field, at a home office or anywhere else they have a Wi-Fi connection and a web browser.</p>

<div class="section-header">
  <h2>Quick and Real-Time Access to Backups</h2>
</div>

<p>Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP updates are regularly deployed to ensure clients can access important advanced features. All the innovations Aptean delivers are designed to improve the software and the user experience. Aptean prides itself on providing tight modern data security protocols to help ensure protection against data corruption and combat privacy leaks. Fulton's team also creates regular system backups to ensure the safety of data and support business continuity.</p>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"There's always the concern of, 'what if the building catches on fire?' 'Was I able to copy data to the cloud?' Those concerns are always there, but the benefit of having software and data in the cloud and off-site makes it so that it's not something that I have to worry about."</p>

    <h3>Key Result</h3>
    <p><strong>99.9999% Uptime Guarantee</strong></p>
    <p>Migrating PHP's instance of Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP to the cloud allowed the company to have its data available and constantly backed up, with a guaranteed uptime of 99.9999%.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It eased the company's concerns around losing their data if disaster strikes or the hardware fails. Having all data secured within a cloud-based solution allows PHP to optimize restoration time and minimize data loss threats.</p>

<p>When deployed via the cloud, Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP is monitored 24/7 by Aptean's Technology Hub Team. That group is responsible for maintaining and deploying updates to ensure that the SaaS environment is optimized, secured and running when customers need it the most.</p>

<div class="section-header">
  <h2>Company Growth and Scalability with Cloud</h2>
</div>

<p>PHP is known for using a revolutionary installation method that allows the business to provide the best results for clients without worrying about breaching warranty clauses. With the exceptional service that the company provides, PHP requires a solution that can keep up with the increase in customer demands, as well as changes in market trends.</p>

<p>Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP supports the organization in this effort, as the solution allows PHP to get straight to work without worrying about moving physical servers into new locations when leadership decides that it's time to level up operations.</p>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"Our goal is to get to the point where we pretty much have all our software and everything that we do in the cloud. Not really having any extra hardware here other than our connection to the internet and maybe some storage solutions."</p>
  <p class="attribution">— Jason Fulton, IT Manager</p>
</div>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"Most of our data is in the cloud at this point, and being able to move Aptean Industrial Manufacturing ERP into a cloud environment has given us freedom."</p>
  <p class="attribution">— Jason Fulton, IT Manager</p>
</div>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"I think that everything's essentially going to the cloud—and there's no stopping it. To make your business successful in the future, cloud deployment definitely gives you the freedom to move forward and grow without the boundaries of hardware."</p>
  <p class="attribution">— Jason Fulton, IT Manager</p>
</div>

<p>Through a successful and effective cloud implementation of a purpose-built ERP solution, PHP is now able to say their business is not only scalable but also future-proofed. There will be no expensive hardware to purchase and no physical data centers required in the future, which will help reduce maintenance and replacement expenses. The company's cloud environment is also flexible and able to accommodate any changes in the number of users, system permissions or back-end options that may surface in the future as the organization continues to grow.</p>

<div class="section-header">
  <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
</div>

<p>Fulton offers some insight for other industrial and discrete manufacturing businesses that want to begin or advance a digital transformation initiative by deploying cloud-enabled software solutions.</p>

<p>Hardware and physical servers have some drawbacks, as you have to consider replacing them after some years. For smaller companies, this can be a considerable expense, which is generally best avoided since such businesses are always watching the bottom line.</p>

<p>A full on-premise-to-SaaS migration is a business decision that Fulton considers a worthy investment.</p>

<div class="case-study-quote">
  <p>"It's definitely worth the money, and I'd recommend moving to the cloud. Our system flows very smoothly, and Aptean is continually improving the solution and evolving it the right way."</p>
  <p class="attribution">— Jason Fulton, IT Manager</p>
</div>

<p>In conclusion, Fulton encourages other manufacturers to act promptly to take advantage of a cloud-based solution.</p>

<div class="case-study-quote">
