      <p class="text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-10 text-center">
        Hey, I'm Bryan Jacinto, a copywriter, content strategist, and aspiring digital entrepreneur with over seven years of experience turning ideas into words that connect, convert, and make people feel something.
      </p>

    <article class="prose max-w-none scroll-reveal-item">
      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>My story started back in high school, when I first stumbled into freelancing. I was writing blog posts and ad copy between classes, just curious about how words could grab attention or inspire action. What began as a small side hustle quickly became a passion for communication, creativity, and helping brands tell stories that actually matter.</p>
      
      <p>Since then, I've grown into a full-time content writer who helps businesses—from startups to established brands—find their voice and grow online. I've worked across industries like real estate, tech, and B2B marketing, creating content that not only sounds great but delivers real results.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not writing, you'll probably find me skateboarding, tinkering with web code, or building something new. I actually built this portfolio website myself from the ground up while learning web development, which has become another creative outlet for me. Right now, I'm focusing on growing my skills in that area and working toward starting my own digital marketing agency soon.</p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>Before I write anything, I do my homework. I take time to understand your audience, your industry, and what makes your offer unique. That's how I make sure every piece of content not only reads well but also performs well.</p>
      
      <p>I blend classic copywriting principles with modern SEO and AI tools like Frase, Jasper, and ChatGPT to brainstorm and research. But every final word is human-written, intentional, and aligned with your brand's goals.</p>

      <h3>What I Value</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity over cleverness:</strong> I want people to understand, not just admire the writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence before opinion:</strong> Data and insight lead to stronger ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Measured impact:</strong> Every piece of content should have a purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous growth:</strong> The digital world changes fast, and I like keeping up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>I've worked across multiple industries and company sizes, from running SEO campaigns for 30+ local brands at iPresence Digital Marketing to writing technical content for enterprise software at Aptean.</p>
      
      <p>Right now, I'm part of GrumpyHare, where I manage SEO content for over 70 real estate clients and lead a small team of writers. I'm also a Content Writer and AI Trainer at Monok, helping shape how AI and human creativity can work together in content creation.</p>

      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>When I'm not behind a keyboard, I'm probably out skating, listening to music, or diving into a new video game. I think those hobbies keep my creativity alive and remind me that great storytelling is all about flow and emotion.</p>

      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <p>Right now, I'm focusing on improving my web development skills and building the foundation for my own digital marketing agency. My goal is to combine everything I've learned about content, SEO, and strategy to help brands grow in authentic, meaningful ways.</p>
      
      <p>If you're looking for someone who can bring creativity, strategy, and results together, I'd love to work with you.</p>
