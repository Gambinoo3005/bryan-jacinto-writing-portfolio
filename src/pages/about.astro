        Hey, I'm Bryan Jacinto. I'm a copywriter and content strategist with seven years of experience turning ideas into words that connect and convert.
      </p>

    <article class="prose max-w-none scroll-reveal-item">
      <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
      <p>I started freelancing in high school, writing blog posts and ad copy between classes. What began as curiosity about how words grab attention turned into a full-time career helping brands find their voice and grow online.</p>

      <p>Since then, I've worked across real estate, tech, and B2B marketing, creating content that sounds great and delivers results. Right now, I manage SEO content for over 70 real estate clients at GrumpyHare and train AI models as a Content Writer at Monok.</p>

      <p>I also built this portfolio website myself while learning web development this year. Turns out I like building things with code as much as I like building things with words.</p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>I do my homework before I write anything. I dig into your audience, your industry, and what makes you different. That's how I make sure content doesn't just read well, it performs.</p>

      <p>I use AI tools like ChatGPT and Jasper for research and brainstorming, but every final word is human-written, intentional, and aligned with your goals.</p>

      <h3>What I Value</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity over cleverness:</strong> I want people to understand, not just admire the writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence before opinion:</strong> Data and insight lead to stronger ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Measured impact:</strong> Every piece should have a purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous growth:</strong> The digital world changes fast. I keep up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <p>I'm building my web dev skills and laying the groundwork for my own digital marketing agency. The goal is to combine everything I've learned about content, SEO, and strategy to help brands grow in authentic ways.</p>

      <p>When I'm not working, you'll find me skateboarding, listening to music, or diving into a new game. Those hobbies keep my creativity alive and remind me that great storytelling is about flow and emotion.</p>

      <p>If you're looking for someone who brings creativity, strategy, and results together, let's talk.</p>
