# Hero Section Gap Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
There was a visible gap between the sticky header and hero section on Vercel deployment (and briefly on localhost during initial load).

## Root Cause
**Double padding stacking:**
1. `BaseLayout.astro` line 127: `pt-[88px]` on `#smooth-content` (accounts for 88px sticky header height)
2. `index.astro` line 478: Additional `padding: 75px 0 0 0 !important;` on `.hero-section`

**Total gap = 88px + 75px = 163px** instead of just the 88px header height.

## Why It Appeared Different on Localhost
The split-second correction you saw on localhost was likely due to:
- GSAP ScrollSmoother initialization timing
- JavaScript loading and adjusting layout
- On Vercel, the timing/initialization might differ slightly, making the gap persist

## Changes Made

### Desktop (index.astro lines 473-484)
**Before:**
```css
.hero-section {
  padding: 75px 0 0 0 !important; /* Extra padding causing gap */
  align-items: flex-start !important;
}
```

**After:**
```css
.hero-section {
  padding: 0 !important; /* No top padding - BaseLayout handles offset */
  align-items: center !important; /* Center content vertically */
}
```

### Mobile (index.astro lines 486-502)
**Before:**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero-section {
    padding: 0 0 8rem 0 !important;
  }
  .hero-section > div {
    margin-top: 6.5rem !important; /* Compensating margin */
  }
}
```

**After:**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero-section {
    padding: 4rem 0 8rem 0 !important; /* Proper padding instead of margin */
  }
  /* Removed .hero-section > div margin-top hack */
}
```

## Result
- Hero content now starts immediately after the 88px header offset
- No visible gap on both localhost and Vercel deployment
- Consistent behavior across all environments
- Mobile spacing properly handled with padding instead of margin hacks

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/index.astro` (lines 473-502)

## Testing
1. Check localhost:4321 - hero should be flush against header
2. Deploy to Vercel - gap should be eliminated
3. Test mobile responsive views - spacing should be consistent

## Other Pages
No changes needed for:
- `/work` - Uses `py-16` consistently
- `/blogs` - Uses `py-16` consistently  
- `/about` - Uses `py-16` consistently
- `/dev-log` - Should mirror the same pattern

These pages already work correctly because they don't have conflicting padding with the BaseLayout's `pt-[88px]`.
